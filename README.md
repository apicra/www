Softreck Apicra is delivering shell scripts needed to deploy applications and solutions across any architectures and enironments, such:
+ Linux
+ Mac OS
+ Windows

## The Apicra solution

is defining native OS scripts to generate enironment based on current system.
It's help to make a standarisated enironment modules, such python environment with definied versions used in your organisation

Code and Enironment are created as sepearated repository but working togheter.
To use Application, create environment and use it depends your server or local machine environment.

This is one defined layer more between application and environment to controll it not depends virtualisation in docker or another virtualisation.

## just USE it

    DOWNLOAD -> INSTALL -> RESTART

Each script has as first "echo" line, the information for what he is started

Each scripts is responsibly and check if some data or application are existing
+ if APP is INSTALLed
+ if FILE is DOWNLOADed


## Example with ProMaGen
+ code: https://github.com/promagen/one
+ environment for windows: https://github.com/promagen/windows
+ environment for debian linux: https://github.com/promagen/debian
