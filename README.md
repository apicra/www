Softreck Apicra product is delivering the scripts needed to deploy applications and solutions across any architectures on many enironments, such:
+ Linux
+ Mac OS
+ Windows

## The Apicra solution
is defining native scripts to generate enironment
It's help to make a standarisated enironment modules, such python environment with definied versions used in your organisation

Code and Enironment are created as spearated repository but working togheter.
To use Application, create environment and use it depends your server or local machine environment.

This is one defined layer more between application and environment to controll it not depends virtualisation in docker or another virtualisation.
